# JDK - jenv wrapper and JDK installation tool

## prerequisites

The jdk wrapper needs the following prerequisites:

* [jenv](https://www.jenv.be/) - a command line tool to help you forget how to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable
* [yank](https://github.com/mptre/yank) - a command line tool that lets you select text from the stdin

Both jenv and yank can be installed via brew with the following command:

```shell
brew install jenv
brew install yank

```

## installation
Put the jdk script in your path and make it executable
